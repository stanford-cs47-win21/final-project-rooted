# Rooted High Fidelity Prototype

## Tools
We created our high-fidelity prototype using React Native and Expo. The app is optimized for the iPhone 11 Pro and we tested it using Apple's Simulator.

## Installing and Operating Rooted Using Expo
We recommend accessing Rooted with an iOS device, namely an iPhone X or iPhone 11 Pro. To download and run Rooted, follow these steps:

1. Download "Expo Go" from the App Store
2. Sign in with username: rootedgreenwork@gmail.com / password: rooted123
3. In your phone browser, visit: https://expo.io/@rootedgreenwork/Rooted
4. Proceed to open in the Expo Go App

## Installing and Operating Rooted Using Source Code
To download and run Rooted from the source code, follow these steps on an Apple Device:

1. Clone github repo
2. In command line, cd into the Rooted directory within the repo
3. Run the following command: ```expo start --ios```

## Limitations
### Hard Coded Elements
Our high-fidelity prototype is a work in progress! To optimize the user experience at this stage of development, we implemented a few hard coded features.

1. When logging and creating a custom action, the image field automatically populates with a recycling photo, rather than opening to the user's camera roll.
2. The user can only post as Clara MacAvoy.
3. The 3 posts in the feed are preset.
4. The user's current teams and challenges are preset.
5. The user's gift cards and balances are preset.

## Next Steps
We are excited to implement the following features in the near future!

1. Requesting to join teams and creating new teams.
2. The join challenges task flow (although, this was not 1 of our 3 tasks).
3. Provide additional stores for the user to redeem their balance at.
4. Monthly and weekly statistics.
