# Rooted High Fidelity Prototype

## Tools
We created our high-fidelity prototype using React Native and Expo. The app is optimized for the iPhone 11 Pro and we tested it using Apple's Simulator.

## Installing and Operating Rooted
We recommend accessing Rooted with an iOS device, namely an iPhone X or iPhone 11 Pro. To download and run Rooted, follow these steps:
1. Download "Expo Go" from the App Store
2. Sign in with username: rootedgreenwork@gmail.com / password: rooted123
3. In your phone browser, visit: https://expo.io/@rootedgreenwork/Rooted
4. Proceed to open in the Expo Go App

## Limitations
Our high-fidelity prototype is a work in progress! To optimize the user experience at this stage of development, we implemented a few hard coded and Wizard of Oz features.
